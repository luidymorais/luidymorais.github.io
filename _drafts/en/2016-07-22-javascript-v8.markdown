I've studied a little bit of node.js and I had an opportunity to get how the javascript works in server.

Indeed, the javascript needs an engine to works in server. Under the Google Chrome Web Browser we need this structure.

Google created the V8 engine to supply every javascript which Chrome executes.

With C++ the V8 was created, logically the C++ language is some of the languages which you can reach an excellent performance.

The javascript code is converted to machine code by V8 engine. Wow... are you saying me the javascript code it'll transform to machine code? Really?
