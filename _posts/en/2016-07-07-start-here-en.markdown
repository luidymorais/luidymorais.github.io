Hi,


I've thought to write some posts in english too. Why english if I'm a brazilian man?

I wanna practice my knowledge in english and share a little bit of my IT experience among people.

I live in Brazil and I've learned the english and I haven't have the opportunity to practice them, I believe I can do this by writing.

Probably I'll make mistakes and if you see one, don't hesitate on telling me.


See ya...
